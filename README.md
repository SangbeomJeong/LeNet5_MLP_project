# LeNet5_MLP_project


# MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements digit classification on the MNIST dataset using the PyTorch framework. It includes two models: the classic LeNet-5 and a custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) designed to have a similar number of parameters as LeNet-5. The goal is to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy and loss over multiple training epochs.

# Model Implementations and Parameter Calculations
## LeNet-5 Architecture:

Input: 1x28x28 image (since MNIST images are 28x28 pixels and grayscale)

C1: Convolutional layer with 6 filters of size 5x5, stride 1 (output: 6x24x24)

S2: Max pooling layer with size 2x2, stride 2 (output: 6x12x12)

C3: Convolutional layer with 16 filters of size 5x5, stride 1 (output: 16x8x8)

S4: Max pooling layer with size 2x2, stride 2 (output: 16x4x4)

C5: Fully connected layer with 120 units

F6: Fully connected layer with 84 units

Output: Fully connected layer with 10 units (10 classes)

### Parameter Calculation for LeNet-5:
conv1:(1x5x5+1)x6=156 parameters
conv2: (6x5x5+1)x16=2,416 parameters
fc1: (16×4×4+1)×120=30,840 parameters
fc2: (120+1)×84=10,164 parameters 
fc3: (84+1)x10=850 parameters

total parameters in LeNet-5 : 156 + 2,416+ 30,840+ 10,164+ 850 = 44,426

## Custom MLP Architecture::
Input: Flattened 1x28x28 image (784 inputs)

Hidden Layer 1: 500 units

Hidden Layer 2: 150 units

Output: 10 units (10 classes)

### Parameter Calculation for Custom MLP:
fc1: (784+1)x500 = 392,500 parameters

fc2: (500+1)x150= 75,150 parameters

fc3 : (150+1)x10 = 1,510 parameters

total parameters in Custom MLP : 392,500+75,150+1,510 = 469,160

# Performance Comparison
In this project, we evaluated two models on the MNIST dataset: the classic LeNet-5 and a custom-designed Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that has a similar number of parameters as LeNet-5. The goal was to compare their performance in terms of accuracy and loss across multiple training epochs.

Testing Loss: C.CCCC

## Analysis and Discussion
The LeNet-5 model generally exhibits higher accuracy compared to the custom MLP model. This superiority can be attributed to the convolutional layers of LeNet-5, which are effective at learning spatial hierarchies in images. Despite having fewer parameters, convolutional networks can extract significant spatial features, outperforming the relatively complex MLP model in tasks such as image classification.

The accuracy of LeNet-5 on the test dataset should align closely with known benchmarks (e.g., around 99%). If the observed accuracy deviates significantly from this range, it may indicate issues with learning parameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs), data preprocessing methods, or possible errors in the model implementation.

## Conclusion
In this study, the LeNet-5 model demonstrated performance close to known benchmarks and achieved lower losses and higher accuracies than the custom MLP model. These results suggest that convolutional neural networks like LeNet-5 are more suited for tasks involving image classification, such as MNIST digit classification.
