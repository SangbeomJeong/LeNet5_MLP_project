# LeNet5_MLP_project


# MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements digit classification on the MNIST dataset using the PyTorch framework. It includes two models: the classic LeNet-5 and a custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) designed to have a similar number of parameters as LeNet-5. The goal is to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy and loss over multiple training epochs.

## Project Structure

- `dataset.py`: Contains the MNIST dataset handling including loading and transforming images.
- `model.py`: Defines the architectures of LeNet-5 and CustomMLP.
- `main.py`: Main script to execute training and testing of the models.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to run it.
